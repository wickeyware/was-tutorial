Reach the next One Billion users, AppStore for Progressive WebApps.

## Progressive Web App Store

Reach the next One Billion users. WickeyAppStore is a full featured App Store for **PWA** web-apps. A **PWA** makes use of new Web and JavaScript API to deliver an experience similar to a native app on the web.

Apps on the WickeyAppStore must meet quality and security requirements:

* **Safety** - must be served via HTTPS to ensure that the real content has not been tampered.
* **Responsive** - can fit all resolutions like desktop, tablet and mobile.
* **Progressive**- work in all modern browsers because they use progressive enhancement concepts.
* **Connectivity independent** - need to work on any type of connection, including offline.
* **Engageable** - using push notifications, "add to home" feature to be more app-like.

## Benefits

* **Trust** - each app is vetted and approved manually.  Only high quality apps are featured on the WickeyAppStore.
* **Single Sign On** - you do not need to sign into apps you do not know or trust. Your WickeyAppStore SSO is all you need.
* **Monetization** - we provide monetization tools including in-app purchases and ads.
* **Traffic** - we feature unique and cool apps, and all apps benefit from being under one umbrella.â€¨
